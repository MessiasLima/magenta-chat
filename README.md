# Magenta Chat

Magenta chat is a simple application that simulates a chat feature between 2 users.

## Project decisions

The application was made following the MVVM architecture and the Google guidelines for android
development.

### ðŸ“š Used libraries and frameworks

- [_Jetpack Compose_](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) for construct the interfaces
- [_Hilt_](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) for dependency injection
- [_Room_](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) for data persistence
- [_Kotlin Coroutines_](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) for managing
  asynchronous tasks and data flows
- [_JUnit_](https://junit.org/junit4/) for test setup and assertions
- [_Mockk_](https://mockk.io/) for creating mock objects for testing
- [_Kotlin fixture_](https://github.com/appmattus/kotlinfixture) for creating dummy objects for
  testing

### Other decisions

#### Conventional commits

Conventional commits is an specification of how we should write commit messages in order to make it
more readable and organized. It also make possible automatic changelog creation. The full
documentation can be found [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

In a normal situation I would setup some gradle plugins
like [this commit lint plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/ru.netris.commitlint)
and [this git hook plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.star-zero.gradle.githook) to ensure
that everyone is following this pattern. I decided not to do it in this project to keep it simpler.

#### Composable components

The UI parts were made as independent components in order to make ir more easily reusable.

#### State hoisting

The composables were made to be the most stateless as possible. Receiving data models through the
arguments and passing the event handling to the parent composable.

#### Flow exposure on ViewModel

Flows are exposed on the ViewModel so the UI can observe it and react when the view model value
changes.

#### Room DAO returning Flow

Flows are being exposed by the DAO interface. This way we can take advantage of the Room-Coroutines
integration and make our query observable. Doing this, everytime the query dataset changes, the UI
is automatically updated.

#### UI Models

During the message fetching, the `MessageEntity` objects are mapped to `ChatUiModel`. Thus the
presentation layer receives only the data that will be shown, already parsed and user readable. Then
the presentation layer can build the component list based on the models it receives.

In a bigger application, I would introduce another kind of model: the domain models. The domain
models would be purely data classes. Without any framework specific annotation or reference.

So the domain logic would interact only the domain ones and we can detach all the
database/ui/network specific classes from the business logic. I didnt do that because of time constraints.

#### Resource provider

The resource provider was created to detach the Android resource manipulation classes from the mapping logic.
This way we can test logic that uses android resources without having an actual Android `Context`.

### Next steps...
- Component to be shown when there is no message on the list. Some icon and a text like "Say hi to your new match!"
- Confirmation dialog when the user clicks on back arrow.
- Domain models
- Detekt and Ktlint integration
- Commit lint integration
